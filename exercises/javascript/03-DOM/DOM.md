## What is the DOM?

Document Object Model
Nodes/Elements created by the browser

Object Oriented Representation
    *   Each node has its own set of properties that can be manipulated.
    *   Add, change, remove
    *   Nodes can be siblings/parents/etc.
    *   Jquery makes these things possible, but anything you can do in Jquery you can do with vanilla javascript.
