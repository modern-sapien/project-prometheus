Hello also!
<!-- php parses HTML -->
<h1>hello</h1>

<!-- If we want to code in PHP we have to PHP tags -->
 <?php 
    // this is a single line comment
    
    # also a single line comment

    /*
    multi line syntax
    */
    echo "hello world"  
    ?>
 
 <!-- Php can also be wrapped in HTML tags, as long as the PHP tag is closed -->
 <h2>
 <?php
    print "hello there";                
    ?>      
</h2>

<!-- echo does not return a value, whereas print returns 1 -->
<!-- echo is faster, and is preferred -->
